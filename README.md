# DirectoryManipulator

The goal of this project was to learn about Linux system calls and library routines through directory manipulation. 

Directory Manipulator is a program that when given the path of a directory in a Linux file system, makes a new reversed version of the entire directory tree including reversing all the file contents within the original directory. It does not modify the original directory, however, it recursively explores all the sub-directories and files, creating reversed versions of them in a new-folder.
